    <h3>Hello! Welcome to Plagiarism Checker!</h3>
<br>
    <p>This web application was created as a final project for <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x">Harvard's CS50x course</a>. Its purpose is to check for possible plagiarism among multiple texts at once.</p>
    <p>User can submit a lot of text files at once. Then, the program calculates the similarity between files in for every possible pair. Finally, it shows all pairs sorted by similarity % within each pair.</p>

    <h6>What is Plagiarism?</h6>
    <p>Definition via University of Oxford (<a href=https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/academic/guidance/skills/plagiarism>source</a>):
    <p>"Plagiarism is presenting someone elseâ€™s work or ideas as your own, with or without their consent, by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgement.
    All published and unpublished material, whether in manuscript, printed or electronic form, is covered under this definition. Plagiarism may be intentional or reckless, or unintentional. Under the regulations for
    examinations, intentional or reckless plagiarism is a disciplinary offence."</p>
<br>
    <h6>Is Plagiarism a crime?</h6>
    (Via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism">Wikipedia</a>) Generally, plagiarism is not in itself a crime, but like counterfeiting fraud can be punished in a court for prejudices caused by copyright infringement,
    violation of moral rights, or torts. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense. Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable
    extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by
    courts.
